                <h2>Our Founding Story</h2>
                <p>The MinwaJayne Foundation was born from a deep desire to make a tangible difference in the lives of vulnerable communities across Kenya. Our journey began with a simple yet powerful vision: to create a foundation that would serve as an umbrella for various community initiatives, bringing together resources, expertise, and compassion to address the most pressing needs of our society.</p>
                <p>Named after Minwa Jayne, a symbol of nurturing and leadership, our foundation embodies the values of love, kindness, and altruism. We believe that every individual deserves access to basic necessities, education, and opportunities to thrive, regardless of their circumstances.</p>
                <div class="founder-quote">
                    <h4 class="quote-tagline">The Heart Behind Our Name</h4>
                    <blockquote>
                        "Minwa means 'Our Mom' in Luo, my mother tongue. This foundation is named in honor of my mother, Jayne—a resilient single mom who raised my brother and me with love, strength, and an unshakable commitment to our future. I watched her work tirelessly to ensure we had a good life and the best education. That sacrifice, that love, and her never-give-up spirit inspired the heartbeat of this foundation."
                        <cite>— Kimberly Agunda, Founder</cite>
                    </blockquote>
                </div>
                <p>What started as a small initiative has grown into a comprehensive foundation that touches the lives of countless individuals through our various programs and partnerships. Our commitment to practical, consistent outreach has allowed us to build trust within communities and create lasting impact.</p>
                <p>The Minwa Jayne Foundation was officially launched on Mother's Day, May 2023, as a tribute to the spirit of motherhood and the nurturing, sacrificial love mothers show the world.</p>

We provide nutritious meals to children, families, and individuals who struggle with regular access to food. Through partnerships with local communities and organizations, we ensure that no one goes hungry.</p>
                    <p>Poverty and food insecurity continue to affect countless households in our communities, especially those led by single mothers. Through this program, we identify and support vulnerable women—particularly single mothers, widows, and women living in informal settlements—with monthly food packages and essential household supplies such as cooking oil, maize flour, beans, soap, and sanitary items. We work closely with local leaders and community-based organizations to ensure that our support reaches those most in need. Beyond food relief, this initiative is rooted in restoring dignity and offering a sense of security to women who are often carrying heavy burdens in silence. Through our consistent outreach, we aim to ease their immediate struggles while connecting them with empowerment programs for longer-term transformation.</p>

                    <p>We work to eliminate period poverty by providing access to menstrual hygiene products and education. Our program ensures that girls and women can manage their periods with dignity and continue their education or work without interruption.</p>
                    <p>Period poverty remains a silent crisis that causes thousands of girls to miss school, face stigma, and suffer silently. Our program addresses this head-on by distributing sanitary towels and menstrual hygiene kits to girls in public schools, informal settlements, and rural areas. But we don't stop at providing materials—we also deliver comprehensive menstrual health education and conduct mentoring sessions focused on building self-esteem, setting life goals, and navigating challenges such as peer pressure and gender-based violence. Our mentors, many of whom are young women from similar backgrounds, serve as relatable role models. By restoring menstrual dignity and reinforcing a girl's right to education and health, this program helps bridge gender gaps and supports girls in realizing their full potential.</p>

                    <p>Children in orphanages and care homes often struggle with emotional neglect and a sense of abandonment. Through our orphanage outreach program, we provide consistent emotional and material support to children living without parental care. Our visits go beyond donations—we engage the children in interactive sessions including storytelling, games, art, and life-skills workshops to foster joy and build confidence. We provide clothes, toys, food supplies, hygiene products, and school items while also spending meaningful time with the children to remind them they are seen, heard, and valued. We aim to nurture their self-esteem and help them feel connected to a community that cares. We also work with caregivers to identify additional needs and offer ongoing support where possible.</p>
